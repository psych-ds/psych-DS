### Definition:

A CSV file under the /data directory in which the official psych-DS compliant data from the dataset is stored. Datafiles must follow Psych-DS file naming conventions, which includes the use of keyword formatting, the '_data' suffix, and the '.csv' extension. An example of a valid datafile might be 'study-123_site-lab4_data.csv'. In the future, more official suffices and extensions may be made available. A controlled list of official keywords is provided, but the use of unofficial keywords is permitted, so long as they are clearly defined and used consistently within a research community.
