# File extension

Definition: A portion of the file name after the left-most period (`.`) preceded by any other alphanumeric.
For example, `.gitignore` does not have a file extension,
but the file extension of 'study-1_data.csv' is '.csv'.
Note that the left-most period is included in the file extension.
