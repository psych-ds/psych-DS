# Raw data

Definition: A central principle for Psych-DS is that the earliest form of the data you have access to should always be saved, 
should never be modified, and should be kept separate from any additional versions created. This data could take any form,
such as physical paper and pencil surveys, digital resources such as videos, etc. At a minimum, it is assumed that a psych-DS
compliant dataset will contain this original data under the /data directory.
