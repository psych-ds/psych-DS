| Property | Value |
|----------|--------|
| [**code**](/en/latest/reference/schema/meta/defs/code) | INVALID_OBJECT_TYPE |
| [**level**](/en/latest/reference/schema/meta/defs/level) | warning |
| [**reason**](/en/latest/reference/schema/meta/defs/reason) | Properties in the schema.org ontology have selective restrictions on which types of objects can be used for their values. Including an object with a @type that does not match the selective restrictions of its property is not an error in psych-DS, but it will result in the object in question not being interpretable by machines.
