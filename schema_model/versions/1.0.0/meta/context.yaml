#
# The context provides the namespaces available to rules.
# These namespaces are used by selectors to define the scope of application
# for a rule, as well as assertions, to determine whether the rule is satisfied.
#
# The dataset namespace is constructed once and is available when visiting all
# files.
#
# All other (current) namespaces are defined on individual files.
# Sidecar metadata and file associations are built according to the inheritance
# principle.
