CsvColumnMissing: 
  code: CSV_COLUMN_MISSING

  reason: A required column is missing
NotIncluded:
  code: NOT_INCLUDED
  level: warning
  reason: |
    Files with such naming scheme are not part of psych-DS specification.
    Under the rules of psych-DS, non-specified files are allowed to be included,
    but if you would like to avoid receiving this warning moving forward, you can include
    in your ".psychdsignore" file
MissingRequiredElement:
  code: MISSING_REQUIRED_ELEMENT
  level: error
  reason: Your dataset is missing an element that is required under the psych-DS specification.
EmptyFile:
  code: EMPTY_FILE
  level: error
  reason: empty files not allowed.
NoHeader:
  code: NO_HEADER
  level: error
  reason: CSV data files must contain a valid header with at least one column.
HeaderRowMismatch:
  code: HEADER_ROW_MISMATCH
  level: error
  reason: The header and all rows for CSV data files must contain the same number of columns.
RowidValuesNotUnique:

KeywordFormattingError:
  code: KEYWORD_FORMATTING_ERROR
  level: error
  reason: |
    All datafiles must use psych-DS keyword formatting. That is, datafile names must consist of
    a series of keyword-value pairs, separated by underscores, with keywords using only lowercase
    alphabetic characters and values using any alphanumeric characters of either case. The file must
    end with '_data.csv'. In other words, files must follow this regex: 
    /([a-z]+-[a-zA-Z0-9]+)(_[a-z]+-[a-zA-Z0-9]+)*_data\.csv/
UnofficialKeywordWarning:
  code: UNOFFICIAL_KEYWORD_WARNING
  level: warning
  reason: |
    Although it is not recommended, datafiles are permitted to use keywords other than those provided
    in the official psych-DS specification. If you do choose to use unofficial keywords, please ensure
    that they are clearly defined within your research community and used consistently across relevant datasets.
UnofficialKeywordError:
  code: UNOFFICIAL_KEYWORD_ERROR
  level: error
  reason: Names for data files must not include keywords other than those listed in the psych-DS schema.
InvalidJsonFormatting:
  code: INVALID_JSON_FORMATTING
  level: error
  reason: One of your metadata files in not in valid JSON format.
IncorrectDatasetType:
  code: INCORRECT_DATASET_TYPE
  level: error
  reason: Your metadata is missing the required schema.org "Dataset" type
MissingDatasetType:
  code: MISSING_DATASET_TYPE
  level: error
  reason: Your metadata is missing the "@type/type" property, which is required.
UnknownNamespace:
  code: UNKNOWN_NAMESPACE
  level: warning
  reason: |
    The psych-DS validator only has access to one external vocabulary, "http://schema.org";
    any other reference to an external schema is permitted, but the validity of the terms used
    cannot be confirmed.
ObjectTypeMissing:
  code: OBJECT_TYPE_MISSING
  level: warning
  reason: |
    For compliance with the schema.org ontology, all objects within the metadata (with a few exceptions)
    that appear as the value of a schema.org key/property must contain a "@type" key with a valid schema.org type 
    as its value.
InvalidSchemaorgProperty:
  code: INVALID_SCHEMAORG_PROPERTY
  level: warning
  reason: |
     The schema.org ontology contains a fixed set of legal properties which can be applied to objects within the metadata.
      If schema.org is used as the only @context within your metadata, then all properties will be interpreted as schema.org properties.
      Using an invalid schema.org property is not considered an error in the psych-DS specification, but it should be understood
      that such usages result in the property in question not being interpretable by machines.
InvalidObjectType:
  code: INVALID_OBJECT_TYPE
  level: warning
  reason: |
    Properties in the schema.org ontology have selective restrictions on which types of objects can be used for their values.
    including an object with a @type that does not match the selective restrictions of its property is not an error in psych-DS,
    but it will result in the object in question not being interpretable by machines.
