KeywordFormattingError:

    All datafiles must use psych-DS keyword formatting. That is, datafile names must consist of
    a series of keyword-value pairs, separated by underscores, with keywords using only lowercase
    alphabetic characters and values using any alphanumeric characters of either case. The file must
    end with '_data.csv'. In other words, files must follow this regex:

UnknownNamespace:

  level: warning

ObjectTypeMissing:
  code: OBJECT_TYPE_MISSING
  level: warning
  reason: |
    For compliance with the schema.org ontology, all objects within the metadata (with a few exceptions)
    that appear as the value of a schema.org key/property must contain a "@type" key with a valid schema.org type 
    as its value.
  requires: 
    - rules.files.common.dataset_description
    - rules.files.tabular_data.data.Datafile
InvalidSchemaorgProperty:
  code: INVALID_SCHEMAORG_PROPERTY
  level: warning
  reason: |
     The schema.org ontology contains a fixed set of legal properties which can be applied to objects within the metadata.
      If schema.org is used as the only @context within your metadata, then all properties will be interpreted as schema.org properties.
      Using an invalid schema.org property is not considered an error in the psych-DS specification, but it should be understood
      that such usages result in the property in question not being interpretable by machines.
  requires: 
    - rules.files.common.dataset_description
    - rules.files.tabular_data.data.Datafile
InvalidObjectType:
  code: INVALID_OBJECT_TYPE
  level: warning
  reason: |
    Properties in the schema.org ontology have selective restrictions on which types of objects can be used for their values.
    including an object with a @type that does not match the selective restrictions of its property is not an error in psych-DS,
    but it will result in the object in question not being interpretable by machines.
