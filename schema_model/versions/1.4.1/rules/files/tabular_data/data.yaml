  troubleshooting: |
    To resolve this error, make sure that your "data" directory contains at least one file that conforms to the proper naming conventions for Psych-DS datafiles. This means that the filename is composed of a sequence of key-value pairs called "keywords", separated by underscores, and ends with the sequence "_data.csv". Psych-DS provides a set of standard [keyword keys](../schema/meta/defs/keywords/) to use, such as "**subject**" and "**session**", but custom keys are allowed, as long as they don't contain any numbers or special characters and provided that they are clearly defined and used in a consistent manner. 

      For reference, here are some valid datafile names:

      
      subject-XYZ_session-2_data.csv
      study-ExampleStudy_data.csv
      study-ExampleStudy_condition-2_data.csv

      and here are some invalid names:

      data.csv
      subject-XYZ_data2.csv
      condition1-A_condition2-C_data.csv
      subject-XYZ.csv
