    If you look at your metadata file and can see that any of the required fields are missing, make sure to add them and provide appropriate, informative values for them. If you do seem to have these fields already, then there may be an issue with your `@context` field, which should contain the standard namespace for Psych-DS metadata, `https://schema.org/`. We include this value because rich metadata objects should have fields that are not just arbitrary strings, but publicly available terms with conventional definitions. In the process of loading a JSON-LD object, every field is attached to the end of the namespace, so the full name for `description` is `https://schema.org/description`, which is a real webpage that you can visit, where you'll see a description of what a `description` is!

  troubleshooting: |
    The simplest way to solve this error is to replace your `variableMeasured` field with the suggested one that the validator generates when this error occurs. If you want to create a rich, informative dataset, though, the best way to solve this issue is to take some time to create a full data dictionary for your dataset. This involves taking a look through all of your data files and compiling detailed definitions of every column that you collect data for, and compiling those definitions into rich `PropertyValue` objects. For instance, here's a `PropertyValue` object for a column header like `Response Time`.

    {
        "@type": "PropertyValue",
        "name": "Response Time",
        "description": "The time (in ms) that elapses between the onset of the stimulus and the participant response",

  troubleshooting: |
    To resolve these error, there are a few approaches you might take:
    - Open your data file in a text editor and confirm that it has at least one line of text. This should be a row of "column headers" that describe the data to be stored in each column. Headers should be separated by commas (`,`).
    - Confirm that all rows have the same number of columns. In general, this means that each row should have the same number of columns, but this is not strictly the case. Cells in a given row can contain a comma that isn't intended as a [delimiter](https://www.ninjaone.com/it-hub/it-service-management/what-is-a-delimiter/#:~:text=A%20delimiter%20is%20a%20sequence,sequence%20of%20comma%2Dseparated%20values.) (for instance, if one column is used to store an open text response, which may contain commas), but any cell containing non-delimiter commas must be surrounded by double quotes. For example, this is a valid csv:
        `subject,text response
        A123,"I am a CSV, and this is okay"`
    - Confirm that there are no empty lines in your CSV file.
    - Confirm that all opening double quotes have a corresponding closing double quote.

  troubleshooting: |
    If you've chosen to use `row_id` as one of your column header, make sure to go through the columns and confirm that no values are repeated at any point. If you happened to be using the header `row_id` for your own purposes and don't wish to change it, you'll need to rename the header to something different. One easy way to check if your `row_id` column has all unique values is to open the file in a spreadsheet program like excel and use something like a pivot table or a formula to detect repeat values.

FilenameKeywordFormattingError:
  code: FILENAME_KEYWORD_FORMATTING_ERROR
  level: error
  reason: |
    All datafiles must use psych-DS keyword formatting. That is, datafile names must consist of a series of keyword-value pairs, separated by underscores, with keywords using only lowercase alphabetic characters and values using any alphanumeric characters of either case. A keyword-value pair would look something like this: "subject-123a", where "subject" is the keyword and "123a" is the value. The file must end with '_data.csv'. An example file might look like this: "subject-123a_session-2_data.csv". This filename has two keyword-value pairs, separated by an underscore, the "_data" suffix, and the ".csv" extension. In other words, files must follow this regex: /([a-z]+-[a-zA-Z0-9]+)(_[a-z]+-[a-zA-Z0-9]+)*_data\.csv/
  requires: []
  helpUrl: https://psychds-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/schema/rules/errors/FilenameKeywordFormattingError/
  troubleshooting: |
    One easy way to check the validity of your filenames is to use this [regular expression (regex) validator](https://regex101.com/). A regular expression is a special way of describing patterns of characters. The regular expression for Psych-DS datafiles is `([a-z]+-[a-zA-Z0-9]+)(_[a-z]+-[a-zA-Z0-9]+)*_data\.csv`, so if you input this to the regex validator, and then put your filename as a test string, the validator will tell you whether it follows the regex pattern.
