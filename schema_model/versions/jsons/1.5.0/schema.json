There are two types of inherited metadata:\n\n1. Sidecar files, which contain metadata that pertains to one specific datafile. These sidecars\nmust have the exact same name as their corresponding datafile, with the \".json\" extension instead \nof the \".csv\" extension. Sidecars must occupy the same directory as their datafile.\n2. Directory metadata, which always takes the form \"file_metadata.json\". The metadata contained in\nsuch files apply to all datafiles within its directory and all subdirectories thereof.\n\nMetadata key/value pairs found in higher-level JSON files are inherited by all lower levels unless they are explicitly \noverridden by a file at the lower level.\n\nFor example, suppose we have the following project structure:\n\ndata/\n  file_metadata.json\n  subject-1/\n    file_metadata.json\n    subject-1_condition-A_data.csv\n    subject-1_condition-B_data.json\n    subject-1_condition-B_data.csv\n  subject-2/\n    subject-2_condition-A_data.json\n    subject-2_condition-A_data.csv\n    subject-2_condition-B_data.csv\n\nThere are 4 datafiles within the data/ hierarchy; let's consider which metadata files apply to each one, and in what order \nthe metadata files should be processed/inherited:\n - data/subject-1/subject-1_condition-A_data.csv: There is no JSON sidecar for this file. \n   However, there is a file_metadata.json file in the same directory as the data file, \n   as well as in one above it. The consolidated metadata object would start with the \n   contents of the higher-level file (data/file_metadata.json), and then update it with \n   the contents of the lower-level file (data/subject-1/file_metadata.json).\n - data/subject-1/subject-1_condition-B_data.csv: The same process unfolds as for the previous \n   file; however, the consolidated object is now further updated with the contents of the target \n   data file\u2019s JSON sidecar (i.e., subject-1_condition-B_data.json).\n - data/subject-2/subject-2_condition-A_data.csv: The contents of data/file_metadata.json \n   are read, and then updated with the contents of data/subject-2/subject-2_condition-A_data.json.\n - data/subject-2/subject-2_condition-B_data.csv: There is only a single applicable metadata \n   file (data/file_metadata.json), from which all metadata is read.\n\nNote that any inherited key/value pair from a metadata file replaces the value for the key wholesale,\nand there is no merging processed involved. For instance, if the root metadata file contains a \"variableMeasured\"\nproperty with 10 elements, and a lower level metadata file contains a \"variableMeasured\" property with\n5 elements, the resulting inherited object will only contain the 5 \"variableMeasured\" elements\nfrom the inherited metadata. The lists are not combined in any way, but replaced."
