    Optionally, you can provide an additional metadata file that is named file_metadata.json and overrides dataset_description.json for an entire directory. It will apply to all files within that directory and its subdirectories.

SidecarMetadata:
  baseDir: "data"
  arbitraryNesting: true
  suffix: "data"
  level: warning
  extensions:
    - ".json"
  code: "MISSING_SIDECAR_METADATA"
  reason: |
    Optionally, you can provide an additional 'sidecar' metadata file that has the same name as a data file in the same directory (e.g. 'trial-5_data.csv' and 'trial-5_data.json'). It will override dataset_description.json for that specific csv datafile only.
