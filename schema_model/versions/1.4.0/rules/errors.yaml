    The psych-DS validator only has access to one external vocabulary, "http://schema.org"; any other reference to an external schema is permitted, but the validity of the terms used cannot be confirmed.

ObjectTypeMissing:
  code: OBJECT_TYPE_MISSING
  level: warning
  reason: |
    For compliance with the schema.org ontology, all objects within the metadata (with a few exceptions) that appear as the value of a schema.org key/property must contain a "@type" key with a valid schema.org type as its value. If you are having trouble creating your dataset_description.json file, you can download a template by filling out the form at https://psych-ds.github.io/cedar-wizard-psychds/.

InvalidSchemaorgProperty:
  code: INVALID_SCHEMAORG_PROPERTY
  level: warning
  reason: |
     The schema.org ontology contains a fixed set of legal properties which can be applied to objects within the metadata. If schema.org is used as the only @context within your metadata, then all properties will be interpreted as schema.org properties. Using an invalid schema.org property is not considered an error in the psych-DS specification, but it should be understood that such usages result in the property in question not being interpretable by machines.

InvalidObjectType:
  code: INVALID_OBJECT_TYPE
  level: warning
  reason: |
    Properties in the schema.org ontology have selective restrictions on which types of objects can be used for their values. Including an object with a @type that does not match the selective restrictions of its property is not an error in psych-DS, but it will result in the object in question not being interpretable by machines.
