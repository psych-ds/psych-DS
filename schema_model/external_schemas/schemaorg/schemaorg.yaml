      [RFC 5005](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5005), For example (and as defined
      for Atom), when using data from a feed that represents a collection of items
      that varies over time (e.g. \"Top Twenty Records\") there is no need to have
      newer entries mixed in alongside older, obsolete entries. By marking this feed
      as a CompleteDataFeed, old entries can be safely discarded when the feed is

      \ into some order, often chronological. Unlike [[ItemList]] which is a general\
      \ purpose data structure for lists of things, the emphasis with CreativeWorkSeries\
      \ is on published materials (written e.g. books and periodicals, or media such\
      \ as tv, radio and games).\\\\n\\\\nSpecific subtypes are available for describing\
      \ [[TVSeries]], [[RadioSeries]], [[MovieSeries]], [[BookSeries]], [[Periodical]]\
      \ and [[VideoGameSeries]]. In each case, the [[hasPart]] / [[isPartOf]] properties\
      \ can be used to relate the CreativeWorkSeries to its parts. The general CreativeWorkSeries\
      \ type serves largely just to organize these more specific and practical subtypes.\\\
      \\n\\\\nIt is common for properties applicable to an item from the series to\
      \ be usefully applied to the containing group. Schema.org attempts to anticipate\
      \ some of these cases, but publishers should be free to apply properties of\

      online columns, travel and food guides, TV and radio shows, blogs and other
      independent Web sites. [[CriticReview]]s are typically more in-depth and professionally
      written. For simpler, casually written user/visitor/viewer/customer reviews,
      it is more appropriate to use the [[UserReview]] type. Review aggregator sites
      such as Metacritic already separate out the site's user reviews from selected
      critic reviews that originate from third-party sources.

      \"Like\" or \"+1\" on a social network. It can be considered the [[result]]
      of an [[EndorseAction]] in which the [[object]] of the action is rated positively
      by

      some [[agent]]. As is common elsewhere in schema.org, it is sometimes more useful
      to describe the results of such an action without explicitly describing the
      [[Action]].


      An [[EndorsementRating]] may be part of a numeric scale or organized system,
      but this is not required: having an explicit type for indicating a positive,

      endorsement rating is particularly useful in the absence of numeric scales as
      it helps consumers understand that the rating is broadly positive.

    - 'A FloorPlan is an explicit representation of a collection of similar accommodations,
      allowing the provision of common information (room counts, sizes, layout diagrams)
      and offers for rental or sale. In typical use, some [[ApartmentComplex]] has
      an [[accommodationFloorPlan]] which is a [[FloorPlan]].  A FloorPlan is always
      in the context of a particular place, either a larger [[ApartmentComplex]] or
      a single [[Apartment]]. The visual/spatial aspects of a floor plan (i.e. room
      layout, [see wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_plan)) can be indicated

      trials represented by MedicalTrial, where each subject is randomly assigned
      to a treatment group or a control group before the start of the treatment.

      \nIn practice many news publishers produce a wide variety of article types,\
      \ many of which might be considered a [[NewsArticle]] but not a [[ReportageNewsArticle]].\
      \ For example, opinion pieces, reviews, analysis, sponsored or satirical articles,\
      \ or articles that combine several of these elements.\n\nThe [[ReportageNewsArticle]]\
      \ type is based on a stricter ideal for \\\"news\\\" as a work of journalism,\
      \ with articles based on factual information either observed or verified by\
      \ the author, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.  This often\
      \ includes perspectives from multiple viewpoints on a particular issue (distinguishing\
      \ news reports from public relations or propaganda).  News reports in the [[ReportageNewsArticle]]\
      \ sense de-emphasize the opinion of the author, with commentary and value judgements\
      \ typically expressed elsewhere.\n\nA [[ReportageNewsArticle]] which goes deeper\
      \ into analysis can also be marked with an additional type of [[AnalysisNewsArticle]].\n"

    - "A SpecialAnnouncement combines a simple date-stamped textual information update\n\
      \      with contextualized Web links and other structured data.  It represents\
      \ an information update made by a\n      locally-oriented organization, for\
      \ example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers,  community groups, police,\n\
      \      local government.\n\nFor work in progress guidelines on Coronavirus-related\
      \ markup see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#).\n\
      \nThe motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the [Coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic),\
      \ and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org\n\
      expect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges\
      \ from use. In addition to our\nusual [Github entry](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490),\
      \ feedback comments can also be provided in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#).\n\
      \n\nWhile this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information,\
      \ it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like [CAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol),\
      \ although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover\nthe kinds of everyday\
      \ practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency\
      \ situation.\n\nSeveral kinds of information can be provided:\n\nWe encourage\
      \ the provision of \\\"name\\\", \\\"text\\\", \\\"datePosted\\\", \\\"expires\\\
      \" (if appropriate), \\\"category\\\" and\n\\\"url\\\" as a simple baseline.\
      \ It is important to provide a value for \\\"category\\\" where possible, most\
      \ ideally as a well known\nURL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the\
      \ 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be \\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20\\\
      \\_coronavirus\\\\_pandemic\\\" or \\\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910\\\
      \".\n\nFor many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links\
      \ or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For\
      \ a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value.\
      \ For an inline description, use a [[WebContent]] type, and provide the url\
      \ as a property of that, alongside at least a simple \\\"[[text]]\\\" summary\
      \ of the page. It is\nunlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all\
      \ of the possible properties simultaneously.\n\nWe expect that in many cases\
      \ the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact\
      \ info, [[openingHours]], [[Event]], [[FAQPage]] etc. By linking to those pages\
      \ from a [[SpecialAnnouncement]] you can help make it clearer that the events\
      \ are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the [[category]]\
      \ property of the [[SpecialAnnouncement]].\n\nMany [[SpecialAnnouncement]]s\
      \ will relate to particular regions and to identifiable local organizations.\
      \ Use [[spatialCoverage]] for the region, and [[announcementLocation]] to indicate\
      \ specific [[LocalBusiness]]es and [[CivicStructure]]s. If the announcement\
      \ affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library\
      \ closure that serves an entire region), use both [[spatialCoverage]] and [[announcementLocation]].\n\
      \nThe [[about]] property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus\
      \ of the announcement. We now recommend using [[about]] only\nfor representing\
      \ non-location entities (e.g. a [[Course]] or a [[RadioStation]]). For places,\
      \ use [[announcementLocation]] and [[spatialCoverage]]. Consumers of this markup\
      \ should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of /about for locations\
      \ too.\n\nThe basic content of [[SpecialAnnouncement]] is similar to that of\
      \ an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard))\
      \ feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be\
      \ shared by posting\n[[SpecialAnnouncement]] updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD.\
      \ For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed\nwith the [[webFeed]]\
      \ property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline [[DataFeed]] object, with\
      \ [[encodingFormat]] providing\nmedia type information e.g. \\\"application/rss+xml\\\
      \" or \\\"application/atom+xml\\\".\n"

  SuperficialAnatomy:

    is_a: MedicalEntity
    comments:
    - Anatomical features that can be observed by sight (without dissection), including
      the form and proportions of the human body as well as surface landmarks that
      correspond to deeper subcutaneous structures. Superficial anatomy plays an important
      role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other medical specialties as underlying
      anatomical structures can be identified through surface palpation. For example,
      during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae
      to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used
      to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located
      by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the
      humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size,
      prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue
      support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral
      joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing
      to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially
      visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula,
      implying the underlying dislocation of the joint (the related anatomical structure).

      This title (or work) may have several variants, which EIDR calls \"edits\".
      See [[editEIDR]].


      Since schema.org types like [[Movie]] and [[TVEpisode]] can be used for both
      works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use [[titleEIDR]] alone
      (for a general description), or alongside [[editEIDR]] for a more edit-specific
      description.
